# Day 2 – Assignment

## Prompting Basics (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought)

### Objective

This assignment helps students practice different **prompting techniques** and understand how prompt structure affects LLM outputs. Students will work with **zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting** using the Google GenAI API.

---

## Task 1: Zero-Shot Prompting

1. Write **three zero-shot prompts** for different tasks:

   * One explanation task
   * One summarization task
   * One reasoning task

2. For each prompt:

   * Write the prompt
   * Paste the model response
   * Briefly explain whether the output met your expectations

---

## Task 2: Few-Shot Prompting

1. Create a **few-shot prompt** for one of the following tasks:

   * Sentiment classification
   * Text classification
   * Question answering

2. Your prompt must include:

   * At least **two examples**
   * A clear input for the model to complete

3. Submit:

   * The full prompt
   * The model’s output
   * One paragraph explaining why few-shot prompting improved or did not improve the result

---

## Task 3: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

1. Choose a **reasoning-based problem**, such as:

   * A math word problem
   * A logic question
   * A step-by-step decision problem

2. Write a prompt that explicitly asks the model to **solve step by step**.

3. Submit:

   * The prompt
   * The step-by-step response
   * The final answer

---

## Task 4: API-Based Prompting (Practical)

Use the Google GenAI Python API to run **any one** of the above prompts.

Include:

* Python code used to call the API
* Prompt text
* Output generated by the model

---

## Task 5: Comparison & Reflection

Write a short reflection (150–200 words):

* Which prompting technique worked best for you and why?
* In which situations would you use zero-shot vs few-shot vs chain-of-thought?

---

## Submission Guidelines

* File name: `day2_assignment.md`
* Format: Markdown
* Include code blocks where applicable

---

## Evaluation Criteria

* Correct understanding of prompting techniques
* Prompt clarity and structure
* Quality of analysis and reflection
* Proper use of API and code clarity

---

## Deadline

Submit before the start of **Day 3 session**.
